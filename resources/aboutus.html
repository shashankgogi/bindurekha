        <p>Bindurekha means a line of dots, a verse&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>Founded in 2009 by the husband wife duo of Leena and Manish Gavande, Bindurekha is a venture by chance. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>About Leena Gavande :
        </h3>
        <p>Leena Gavande, Founder Designer of Bindurekha has worked in the HR department of IT companies like Sun Microsystems, Geometric, Bladelogic, BMC software and also has experience in being associated with start ups. The 2008 slow down in IT industry
            gave her a chance to rekindle her passion for jewellery designing and making. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;She explains the transition from IT industry to fashion has been a culmination of an opportunity to pursue my passion of making &nbsp;unique adornments into a very successful business venture. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had managed to pursue my passion of designing one of kind jewellery simultaneously with a career in the software industry. I was never a gold jewellery buff and always wanted something unique and different suiting my tastes. I did not
            like the mass production jewellery in the showrooms and hence started designing my own. The focus was on creating something which was one of a kind or at least not readily available in the market. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>I have a huge circle of friends and many liked my style of jewellery and mix and match look and wanted me to design adornments for them and their friends. As requests and orders began to pile up the need for an organised business enterprise that
            will provide quality products and efficient service became apparent. The venture was named Bindurekha which means a line of dots / a verse and the first store was started in 2009 at INOX multiplex mall, Pune. Now we have scaled up from the
            initial days of beading and mix and match and now Bindurekha also specialises in metal smithing brass, copper and german silver into unique adornments. The products are acid etched / print fused with metal. The entire process is handmade and
            each product takes around 3-7 days. &nbsp;
        </p>
